# Blockchain Project
Bachalor project written in 2017, the project was to implement a working blockchain in haskell and with that gain an understanding of consensus mechanism, distributed networks and the block stucture as well.

# Disclaimer

While the implementation does feature a working POW consensus algrotihm aswell as a suitable data structure, its network ability is not working properly. It should have been an distributed network able to connect unlimitied nodes to each other however at the time i could not get it to work, thus we can only connect a limited number of nodes to each other. This is a major flaw and should be considered when reading the project.

# Structure
- *report/* contains the tex files as well as images for the report
- *code/* contains the haskell code
